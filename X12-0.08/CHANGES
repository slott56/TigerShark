X12::Parser 0.08

A whole lot of changes have gone into this version.
The X12::Parser can now handle files of any size. The earlier versions
of the parser relied on reading the whole X12 file into an array before
parsing. X12::Parser can handle files with multiple ISA segments having
different segment seperators (note it cannot handle different transaction
types within the same file).

1. _parse() method is split into 2 functions _parse_loop_start() and
_parse_loop(). Instead of loading the whole file into an array the file
is read as it is being parsed. _parse_loop_start() and _parse_loop() 
could have been handled within the same function but have kept it
seperate for simplicity. _parse_loop_start() detects start of loops.
_parse_loop() return the loop segments.

2. _set_seperator() function is added. This function sets the segment
seperator and element seperator.

3. get_segments() function is removed. Since we no longer maintain the
whole file in an array, it is difficult to gets the segments in a loop
just by giving the line number where the loop starts.

4. reset_pos() function is removed. Not really used and also now that
we parse the file serially there is no need for this function.

5. get_loop_segment() no longer needs $loop as input.

6. Changes to man page section of the module to reflect the above changes.

7. get_next_pos_loop(), and get_next_pos_level_loop() return segment positions
starting with 1. In previous versions 0 would correspond to the first segment.



X12::Parser 0.04

1. Moved _get_level_one and _get_next_level functions from
Parser.pm to Cf.pm (the new functions in Cf.pm are called
get_level_one and get_next_level). This keeps configuration
related functions within the Cf.pm module.

2. Moved $self members/elements to file globals.

3. Changed $c_L to $current_level and $s to $element_seperator

4. Added $segment_seperator. Added get_segment_seperator() and
get_element_seperator() functions. Modified $line_seperator to
$orig_line_seperator
   

X12::Parser 0.03

1. Fixed problem with parser running out of memory.
Still has issue with very large files.
